# RTSP/WebRTC Website

This repository refers to the according tutorial on my blog _kaanlabs_. Visit the tutorial [Low Latency Webcam-to-Browser Streaming with RTSP/WebRTC](https://kaanlabs.com/low-latency-webcam-to-browser-streaming-with-rtsp-webrtc) for more information.

This sample website demonstrates an implementation on how to establish a session with the [Janus Gateway from Meetecho](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway), in order to receive a live-streamed RTSP/WebRTC video feed with very low latencies.
